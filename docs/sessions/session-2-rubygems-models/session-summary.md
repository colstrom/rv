# Session 2: RubyGems Models Crate - Session Summary

## Overview
Successfully scaffolded and implemented the `rv-gem-types` crate with a fully functional Version model that matches RubyGems behavior.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure
- Created new `rv-gem-types` crate in workspace
- Set up proper module structure with `lib.rs` and individual modules
- Added crate to workspace `Cargo.toml`

### 2. Version Model Implementation
- Created `VersionSegment` enum to replace `Either<String, u32>` for better type safety
- Implemented comprehensive version parsing with proper error handling using `miette`
- Added rubygems-compatible version comparison logic
- Implemented key methods:
  - `new()` - version creation with validation
  - `is_prerelease()` - detects non-numeric segments
  - `canonical_segments()` - removes trailing zeros
  - `release()` - strips prerelease parts
  - `bump()` - increments version following rubygems rules

### 3. Test Coverage
- Ported key test cases from `rubygems/test_gem_version.rb`
- All 11 version tests passing, including:
  - Version creation and parsing
  - Whitespace handling
  - Empty string defaults
  - Invalid version detection
  - Version equality and ordering
  - Prerelease detection
  - Canonical segment handling
  - Release conversion
  - Version bumping
  - SemVer-style comparisons

### 4. RubyGems Compatibility
- Researched and implemented exact rubygems behavior for version parsing
- Correctly handles edge cases like trailing zeros, prerelease versions, and mixed alphanumeric segments
- Bump method follows rubygems algorithm:
  1. Remove trailing string segments (prerelease parts)
  2. If more than one segment, remove the last one
  3. Increment the remaining last segment

## Key Technical Decisions

### VersionSegment Enum
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
pub enum VersionSegment {
    Number(u32),
    String(String),
}
```

This provides better type safety and cleaner code than `Either<String, u32>`.

### Error Handling
Using `miette` for rich error messages that match the rubygems format: `"Malformed version number string {version}"`.

### Version Comparison
Implemented natural ordering where:
- Numbers are compared numerically
- Strings are compared lexicographically
- Numbers sort higher than strings (release > prerelease)
- Smart alphanumeric handling for segments like "a10" vs "a9"

## Current Status
Phase 2 complete - Version model fully implemented and tested. Ready to proceed to Phase 3 (Platform Model) or Phase 2.5 (Requirement Model) as defined in the implementation plan.

## Files Modified
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies (miette, either)
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/lib.rs` - Module exports
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/version.rs` - Complete Version implementation
- `/Cargo.toml` - Added crate to workspace
- Multiple skeleton files for other models (platform, requirement, etc.)

## Next Steps
According to the implementation plan, next phases would be:
1. **Phase 2.5**: Implement Requirement struct with constraint parsing
2. **Phase 3**: Implement Platform model with CPU/OS variants
3. **Phase 4**: Basic specification models (NameTuple, Dependency)
4. **Phase 5**: Full Specification model
5. **Phase 6**: Integration and comprehensive testing
