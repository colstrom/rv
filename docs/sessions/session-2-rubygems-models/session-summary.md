# Session 2: RubyGems Models Crate - Session Summary

## Overview
Successfully scaffolded and implemented the `rv-gem-types` crate with a fully functional Version model that matches RubyGems behavior.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure
- Created new `rv-gem-types` crate in workspace
- Set up proper module structure with `lib.rs` and individual modules
- Added crate to workspace `Cargo.toml`

### 2. Version Model Implementation
- Created `VersionSegment` enum to replace `Either<String, u32>` for better type safety
- Implemented comprehensive version parsing with proper error handling using `miette`
- Added rubygems-compatible version comparison logic
- Implemented key methods:
  - `new()` - version creation with validation
  - `is_prerelease()` - detects non-numeric segments
  - `canonical_segments()` - removes trailing zeros
  - `release()` - strips prerelease parts
  - `bump()` - increments version following rubygems rules

### 3. Test Coverage
- Ported key test cases from `rubygems/test_gem_version.rb`
- All 11 version tests passing, including:
  - Version creation and parsing
  - Whitespace handling
  - Empty string defaults
  - Invalid version detection
  - Version equality and ordering
  - Prerelease detection
  - Canonical segment handling
  - Release conversion
  - Version bumping
  - SemVer-style comparisons

### 4. RubyGems Compatibility
- Researched and implemented exact rubygems behavior for version parsing
- Correctly handles edge cases like trailing zeros, prerelease versions, and mixed alphanumeric segments
- Bump method follows rubygems algorithm:
  1. Remove trailing string segments (prerelease parts)
  2. If more than one segment, remove the last one
  3. Increment the remaining last segment

## Key Technical Decisions

### VersionSegment Enum
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
pub enum VersionSegment {
    Number(u32),
    String(String),
}
```

This provides better type safety and cleaner code than `Either<String, u32>`.

### Error Handling
Using `miette` for rich error messages that match the rubygems format: `"Malformed version number string {version}"`.

### Version Comparison
Implemented natural ordering where:
- Numbers are compared numerically
- Strings are compared lexicographically
- Numbers sort higher than strings (release > prerelease)
- Smart alphanumeric handling for segments like "a10" vs "a9"

### 5. Requirement Model Implementation (Phase 2.5)
- Created comprehensive `Requirement` struct with constraint parsing
- Implemented all comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ~>)
- Added pessimistic operator (~>) with proper version.bump() logic
- Support for multiple constraints with AND logic
- Structured error handling with `RequirementError` enum
- Complete test coverage for all requirement scenarios
- Full rubygems compatibility for requirement parsing and matching

### 6. Platform Model Implementation (Phase 3)
- Created comprehensive Platform enum with Ruby, Current, and Specific variants
- Implemented platform string parsing for all major OS types (Linux, Darwin, Windows, Java, etc.)
- Added CPU architecture detection and normalization (i686 -> x86, etc.)
- Implemented platform matching logic compatible with RubyGems behavior
- Added special handling for Linux version matching vs other platforms
- Created platform display formatting and array conversion methods
- Added comprehensive test coverage for parsing, matching, and display
- Fixed all compilation errors and clippy linting issues

### 7. NameTuple and Dependency Models Implementation (Phase 4)
- Created comprehensive NameTuple model with name, version, and platform fields
- Implemented platform normalization (empty/nil platforms become "ruby")
- Added key methods: full_name(), spec_name(), to_array(), from_array(), null()
- Implemented comparison and sorting logic (name, version, platform priority)
- Added utility methods: prerelease(), match_platform()
- Created complete Dependency model with requirement matching
- Implemented dependency types (Runtime default, Development) with proper handling
- Added version matching with prerelease logic
- Implemented dependency merging functionality
- Added convenience methods: runtime(), development(), with_prerelease()
- Created comprehensive error handling with NameTupleError and DependencyError enums
- Added 22 new tests (11 NameTuple, 11 Dependency) with full coverage
- Fixed Hash implementation for Version type and clippy warnings

### 8. Specification Model Implementation (Phase 5)
- Created comprehensive Specification struct with all key RubyGems fields
- Implemented required fields (name, version, summary, require_paths, specification_version, rubygems_version)
- Added optional fields with proper defaults matching RubyGems behavior
- Implemented builder pattern methods (with_summary, with_authors, with_license, etc.)
- Added dependency management (add_dependency, add_development_dependency, runtime_dependencies, development_dependencies)
- Created comprehensive validation system with structured error reporting
- Implemented Ruby gemspec serialization with to_ruby() method
- Added utility methods (full_name, is_prerelease, has_extensions, executable_names)
- Created extensive test suite with 14 tests including insta snapshot tests for to_ruby() output
- Added insta dependency for snapshot testing of Ruby code generation
- Fixed HashMap ordering in metadata serialization for deterministic output

## Current Status
Phase 5 complete - Version, Requirement, Platform, NameTuple, Dependency, and Specification models fully implemented and tested. All 58 tests passing with full RubyGems compatibility. Complete gem specification system with validation, dependency management, and Ruby code generation. The rv-gem-types crate now provides a comprehensive, RubyGems-compatible model system ready for integration with package management tools.

## Files Modified
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies (miette, either, thiserror)
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/lib.rs` - Module exports
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/version.rs` - Complete Version implementation
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/requirement.rs` - Complete Requirement implementation
- `/Cargo.toml` - Added crate to workspace
- Multiple skeleton files for other models (platform, dependency, etc.)

## Next Steps
According to the implementation plan, next phases would be:
1. **Phase 3**: Implement Platform model with CPU/OS variants
2. **Phase 4**: Basic specification models (NameTuple, Dependency)
3. **Phase 5**: Full Specification model
4. **Phase 6**: Integration and comprehensive testing
