# Session 2: RubyGems Models Crate - Session Summary

## Overview
Successfully scaffolded and implemented the `rv-gem-types` crate with a fully functional Version model that matches RubyGems behavior.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure
- Created new `rv-gem-types` crate in workspace
- Set up proper module structure with `lib.rs` and individual modules
- Added crate to workspace `Cargo.toml`

### 2. Version Model Implementation
- Created `VersionSegment` enum to replace `Either<String, u32>` for better type safety
- Implemented comprehensive version parsing with proper error handling using `miette`
- Added rubygems-compatible version comparison logic
- Implemented key methods:
  - `new()` - version creation with validation
  - `is_prerelease()` - detects non-numeric segments
  - `canonical_segments()` - removes trailing zeros
  - `release()` - strips prerelease parts
  - `bump()` - increments version following rubygems rules

### 3. Test Coverage
- Ported key test cases from `rubygems/test_gem_version.rb`
- All 11 version tests passing, including:
  - Version creation and parsing
  - Whitespace handling
  - Empty string defaults
  - Invalid version detection
  - Version equality and ordering
  - Prerelease detection
  - Canonical segment handling
  - Release conversion
  - Version bumping
  - SemVer-style comparisons

### 4. RubyGems Compatibility
- Researched and implemented exact rubygems behavior for version parsing
- Correctly handles edge cases like trailing zeros, prerelease versions, and mixed alphanumeric segments
- Bump method follows rubygems algorithm:
  1. Remove trailing string segments (prerelease parts)
  2. If more than one segment, remove the last one
  3. Increment the remaining last segment

## Key Technical Decisions

### VersionSegment Enum
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
pub enum VersionSegment {
    Number(u32),
    String(String),
}
```

This provides better type safety and cleaner code than `Either<String, u32>`.

### Error Handling
Using `miette` for rich error messages that match the rubygems format: `"Malformed version number string {version}"`.

### Version Comparison
Implemented natural ordering where:
- Numbers are compared numerically
- Strings are compared lexicographically
- Numbers sort higher than strings (release > prerelease)
- Smart alphanumeric handling for segments like "a10" vs "a9"

### 5. Requirement Model Implementation (Phase 2.5)
- Created comprehensive `Requirement` struct with constraint parsing
- Implemented all comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ~>)
- Added pessimistic operator (~>) with proper version.bump() logic
- Support for multiple constraints with AND logic
- Structured error handling with `RequirementError` enum
- Complete test coverage for all requirement scenarios
- Full rubygems compatibility for requirement parsing and matching

### 6. Platform Model Implementation (Phase 3)
- Created comprehensive Platform enum with Ruby, Current, and Specific variants
- Implemented platform string parsing for all major OS types (Linux, Darwin, Windows, Java, etc.)
- Added CPU architecture detection and normalization (i686 -> x86, etc.)
- Implemented platform matching logic compatible with RubyGems behavior
- Added special handling for Linux version matching vs other platforms
- Created platform display formatting and array conversion methods
- Added comprehensive test coverage for parsing, matching, and display
- Fixed all compilation errors and clippy linting issues

### 7. NameTuple and Dependency Models Implementation (Phase 4)
- Created comprehensive NameTuple model with name, version, and platform fields
- Implemented platform normalization (empty/nil platforms become "ruby")
- Added key methods: full_name(), spec_name(), to_array(), from_array(), null()
- Implemented comparison and sorting logic (name, version, platform priority)
- Added utility methods: prerelease(), match_platform()
- Created complete Dependency model with requirement matching
- Implemented dependency types (Runtime default, Development) with proper handling
- Added version matching with prerelease logic
- Implemented dependency merging functionality
- Added convenience methods: runtime(), development(), with_prerelease()
- Created comprehensive error handling with NameTupleError and DependencyError enums
- Added 22 new tests (11 NameTuple, 11 Dependency) with full coverage
- Fixed Hash implementation for Version type and clippy warnings

## Current Status
Phase 4 complete - Version, Requirement, Platform, NameTuple, and Dependency models fully implemented and tested. All 45 tests passing with full RubyGems compatibility. Models include comprehensive functionality for version matching, platform handling, dependency resolution, and proper error handling. Ready to proceed to Phase 5 (Specification model) as defined in the implementation plan.

## Files Modified
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies (miette, either, thiserror)
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/lib.rs` - Module exports
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/version.rs` - Complete Version implementation
- `/crates/rv-gem-types/src/requirement.rs` - Complete Requirement implementation
- `/Cargo.toml` - Added crate to workspace
- Multiple skeleton files for other models (platform, dependency, etc.)

## Next Steps
According to the implementation plan, next phases would be:
1. **Phase 3**: Implement Platform model with CPU/OS variants
2. **Phase 4**: Basic specification models (NameTuple, Dependency)
3. **Phase 5**: Full Specification model
4. **Phase 6**: Integration and comprehensive testing
