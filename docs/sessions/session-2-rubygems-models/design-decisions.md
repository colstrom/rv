# Session 2: RubyGems Models Crate Design Decisions

## Overview
Creating a new `rb-gem-types` crate to provide Rust implementations of key RubyGems model classes.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Crate Structure
- **Decision**: Create a new crate `rb-gem-types` within the existing workspace
- **Rationale**: Separates concerns and allows for independent versioning of models
- **Alternative**: Implement models directly in the `rv` crate
- **Trade-offs**: Additional complexity but better modularity

### 2. Model Priority
Based on RubyGems research, prioritize implementation in this order:
1. Version/requirement models (most foundational)
2. Dependency models
3. Platform and basic specification models
4. Package
5. Source (look at bundler source subclasses for this one)

### 3. Rust Implementation Strategy
- **Decision**: Use idiomatic Rust patterns with serde for serialization
- **Rationale**: Leverage Rust's type system for safety and performance
- **Key patterns**: 
  - Enums for constrained values (Platform, DependencyType)
  - Structs for data models
  - Traits for shared behavior
  - Result types for error handling

### 4. Version Compatibility
- **Decision**: Focus on modern RubyGems specification format (v4)
- **Rationale**: Simplifies implementation while covering current use cases
- **Alternative**: Support all historical formats
- **Trade-offs**: May need to add legacy support later

### 5. Dependencies
- **Decision**: Minimize external dependencies, use serde for serialization and miette for error handling
- **Rationale**: Reduces dependency tree and improves compile times
- **Key dependencies**: serde, serde_json, semver (for version handling)
