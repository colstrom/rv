# Session 3: rv-gem-specification-yaml - Session Summary

## Session Motivation

This session addressed the critical need for YAML serialization/deserialization of Ruby Gem::Specification objects to enable rv to work with existing Ruby ecosystem tools. Ruby's gemspec YAML format uses tagged objects (`!ruby/object:Gem::Specification`) with complex nested structures that standard YAML libraries cannot handle properly. The goal was to create a dedicated crate providing Ruby-compatible YAML processing with strict validation and comprehensive error reporting.

## Accomplishments

Successfully designed and implemented the `rv-gem-specification-yaml` crate, providing Ruby-compatible YAML deserialization for `Gem::Specification` objects.

### Key Features Implemented
- **Ruby YAML Compatibility**: Handles Ruby's tagged YAML format including `!ruby/object:Gem::Specification`, `!ruby/object:Gem::Version`, `!ruby/object:Gem::Requirement`, and `!ruby/object:Gem::Dependency` tags
- **Complex Version Constraints**: Properly parses multi-constraint requirements like `>= 6.0, < 8.0`
- **Tagged Node Handling**: Custom parsing logic for Ruby's YAML tag system using saphyr's low-level API
- **Nested Object Support**: Correctly handles nested version objects within requirements and dependencies
- **Stable Metadata Ordering**: Uses IndexMap to maintain consistent key ordering in metadata fields

### Technical Implementation
- **Library Choice**: Used `saphyr` instead of `serde_yaml` for flexible tag handling
- **Manual Deserialization**: Implemented custom parsing functions to handle Ruby's specific YAML patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with proper error propagation
- **Testing Strategy**: Generated actual Ruby YAML fixtures and used insta snapshots for regression testing

### Test Coverage
Created 4 comprehensive test cases covering:
- Simple gem specifications
- Complex gems with dependencies and metadata
- Version constraint specifications with multiple operators
- Minimal specifications

### Dependencies Added
- `saphyr` and `saphyr-parser` for YAML parsing
- `indexmap` for ordered metadata storage
- `thiserror` for error handling
- `insta` for snapshot testing

## Technical Lessons Learned

### YAML Tag Handling
Ruby's YAML serialization uses explicit tags that require pattern matching on `Yaml::Tagged(tag, boxed_yaml)` variants rather than simple deserialization.

### Version Constraint Parsing
Ruby requirements can contain multiple constraints that need to be parsed individually and reconstructed as separate requirement strings for the Rust type system.

### Stable Testing
Using IndexMap instead of HashMap ensures deterministic test results by maintaining insertion order for metadata fields.

## Files Created
- `crates/rv-gem-specification-yaml/` - Complete crate structure
- Ruby script for generating YAML test fixtures
- Comprehensive integration tests with snapshot validation
- Session documentation and design decisions

## Impact
The crate provides a foundation for reading Ruby gem specifications from YAML format, enabling rv to work with existing Ruby ecosystem tools and gemspec files while maintaining full compatibility with Ruby's YAML serialization format.
